<!-- Monolithic architecture -->
<!-- Monolithic architecture is a software design pattern in which an application's components  are tightly interconnected and interdependent, forming a single, unified codebase. In a monolithic architecture, the entire application, including its user interface, business logic, and data management, is built as a single, self-contained unit.

Key characteristics of a monolithic architecture include:

1)Single Codebase: The entire application is developed and maintained within a single code repository. All features and functionalities are contained within this codebase.
2)Monolithic architectures were popular in the early days of software development due to their simplicity and ease of development. However, as applications grew larger and more complex, maintaining and scaling monolithic applications became increasingly challenging. This led to the emergence of more modular and scalable architectures, such as microservices and serverless architectures, which aim to address the limitations of monolithic architectures.



<!-- Microservices architecture -->
<!-- Microservices architecture is a software design pattern in which an application is broken down into a collection of small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable services. Each service represents a specific business capability or functionality and is designed to work as a standalone unit. These services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, often using lightweight protocols like HTTP or messaging systems. -->

<!-- Note:-
1)In React, when the state of a component changes, React schedules a re-render of that component. However, the actual re-rendering might not happen immediately; React may batch multiple state updates and perform them in a single pass for performance reasons. This is known as "batching updates."
2)The key idea is that React attempts to optimize the rendering process by grouping together multiple state updates and rendering them in a single batch. This helps prevent unnecessary re-renders and can improve the overall performance of the application. -->
